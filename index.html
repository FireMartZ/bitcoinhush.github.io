              <p>You must HODL your private key (not on an exchange!) in a transparent address. Since only HUSH has shielded addresses in this airdrop,
              HUSH HODLers with value inside of shielded <em>zaddrs</em> must choose to migrate it to taddrs before the snapshot date or simply enjoy their freedom via the zkSNARKs that protect their address balances.</p>

              </ul>

              <p>For each of any other Bitcoin fork, you get nothing.</p>

          <h3 id="will-everything-be-done-and-launch-at-the-above-time">Will everything be done and launch at the above time?</h3>

          <p>No, the full network is expected to launch some time in February, since there needs to be time to decide on a final value for each taddr, and then make many many transactions on the BTCH chain to fill the appropriate taddrs with value on the BTCH chain.</p>

          <h3 id="what-makes-btch-different-than-all-the-other-btc-forks-and-things">What makes BTCH different than all the other BTC forks and things?</h3>

          <p>BTCH is not something that has ever existed before, it is not a chain split nor code fork of HUSH, nor ZEC, nor BTC, it is a KMD asset chain with imported UTXO dataset.</p>

          <p>BTCH takes the <em>value</em> from four different blockchains (HUSH,SUPERNET,DEX,BTC), and then dumps it onto a <em>host chain</em> Komodo (KMD).
          It does not fork from KMD, nor does it fork from BTC or HUSH. It is technically NOT A FORK, but a merged airdrop.</p>

          <p>So BTCH is actually a Komodo asset chain with all the money from four other different blockchains, mixed into one big HODLer tossed salad.
          Also, BTCH is protected by the full hashpower of Bitcoin because Komodo has delayed Proof-Of-Work (dPOW) which essentially syncs the KMD blockchain to the BTC blockchain occasionally. This means that you must have enough hash power to mess with BTC itself to mess with KMD OR a KMD asset chain.</p>

          <h3 id="what-will-happen-to-hush">What will happen to Hush?</h3>

          <p>Hush is the mother chain to BTCH, and has it’s own network, it’s not going anywhere. BTCH is a new coin to try out things that are just simply impossible with one blockchain that already exists. So we had to create a new coin to try these bleeding-edge ideas out, and now you get free money!!!</p>

          <p>Also Hush has very low circulating supply (less than 20% in circulation) and is minable, while BTCH will not be minable and the entire supply will be in circulation.</p>

          <h3 id="what-exchanges-support-btch">What exchanges support BTCH?</h3>

          <p>The first exchange to support BTCH will be BarterDEX, atomic swaps have already been done with KMD and BTCH. Others will follow later.</p>

          <h3 id="total-supply">Total Supply?</h3>

          <p>21,000,000 coins, like Satoshi intended.</p>

          <h3 id="sustainable-development">Sustainable development?</h3>

          <p>Yes, there will be a 150,000 BTCH development fund managed by jl777 to fund ongoing needs of the community.</p>

          <h3 id="what-will-you-do-with-satoshis-coins">What will you do with Satoshi’s Coins?</h3>

          <p>We have no plan to steal Satoshi’s coins like other coins, that seems disrepectful.</p>

          <h3 id="full-whitepaper">Full Whitepaper?</h3>

          <p>You better believe it, it will be released on Github soon.</p>
