# Bitcoin Hush (BTCH): Research + Development Airdrop for HUSH, SUPERNET, DEX and BTC HODLers

Bitcoin Hush is the first project to use Black Mirror-approved [Codger The UTXO Lodger](https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/948680869329317888)  technology to transport UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) across chains (brains) with very little effort and extreme security due to brand new cryptocoin techniques from Duke Leto and jl777.

# How Do I Get my Airdrop?

HODL!!!!!!

A block height closest to (but not later than) 12pm NOON UTC on Jan 16th 2018 will be chosen at the "UTXO migration set", make sure to HODL your coins until then. Unconfirmed transactions in flight WILL NOT BE COUNTED.

# Is this a joke?

No. Have you seen BTG and BTCP? We can actually code, lol!

# Can other coins use Codger The Lodger?

Yes, but it's a seniority-first kind of thing, contact Duke if you are cryptocoin OG.

# What makes BTCH different than all the other BTC shitforks?

BTCH takes the *value* from four different blockchains (HUSH,SUPERNET,DEX,BTC), and then dumps it onto a *mother chain* Komodo (KMD).
So BTCH is actually a Komodo asset chain with all the money from four other different blockchains, mixed into one big HODLer tossed salad.
Also, BTCH is protected by the FULL SECURITY of Bitcoin because Komodo has delayed Proof-Of-Work (dPOW) which essentially synchs the KMD blockchain to the BTC blockchain occasionally. This means that you must have enough hash power to mess with BTC itself to mess with a KMD asset chain.

# What will happen to Hush?

Hush is the mother chain to BTCH, and has it's own network, it's not going anywhere. BTCH is a new coin to try out things that are just simply impossible with one blockchain that already exists. So we had to create a new coin to try these bleeding-edge ideas out, and now you get free money!!!

# What exchanges support BTCH?

The first exchange to support BTCH will be BarterDEX, atomic swaps have already been done with KMD and BTCH. Others will follow later.

# Total Supply?

21,000,000 coins, like Satoshi intended

# Wallets?

Web + Light Wallets Coming Soon
